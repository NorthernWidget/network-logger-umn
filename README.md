Logger
======
This code is heavily based off the the Alog library by Northern Widget. When
completed, this implementation will include radio telemetry using the RFM69 chip
for RF communication. This library is currently a work in progress and should
not be expected to work on its own. Expect a working copy in early May.
The new libraries in this repo are the Network.* files.
